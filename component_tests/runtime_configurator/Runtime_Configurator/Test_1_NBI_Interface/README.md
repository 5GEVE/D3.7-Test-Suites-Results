This script just prints the "Hello World" message. It is based on the example provided in the (following repository)[https://github.com/5GEVE/5geve-rc].

In order to test it:

```sh
# 1. Make sure you download the repository which contains the files (the original one) in both Robot Framework (EEM) and Runtime Configurator servers.
git clone git@github.com:5GEVE/5geve-rc.git

# 2. Modify the variables defined in 5geve-rc/hello_world/robot/hello_world.robot to fit in your scenario.

# 3. Execute the Robot Framework script.
