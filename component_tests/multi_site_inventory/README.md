# Multi-Site Inventory Robot Framework Tests

This folder contains the Robot Framework tests for the Multi-Site Inventory.

Full list of tests, including their description, are provided in Deliverable D3.7.

In this repository, the test cases related to each operation are defined in a single Robot Framework script.

Regarding the results, the checking of MSI information elements in the NS LCM queries is done manually at this moment, based on the logs obtained in the tests (please see [MSNO results](https://github.com/5GEVE/D3.7-Test-Suites-Results/tree/master/component_tests/multi_site_nso))

## Pre-requisites and dependencies

Only Robot Framework is needed for executing all the test cases, which can be easily installed with pip.

```sh
pip install robotframework
```
